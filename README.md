# SoccerCoordinator
This playground project involves coordinating a Soccer League. As part of being the Coordinator, I needed to divide the 18 children who have signed up for the league into three even teams. However, in order to make every team an even playing field, I assigned them to teams such the number of experienced players on each team are the same. 
The project also includes a logic that iterates through all three teams of players and generates a personalized letter to the guardians, letting them know which team their child has been placed on and when they should attend their first team practice game. 
In addition, I also created a logic to ensure the average heights of each team as well as having each team contain the same number of experienced players.
